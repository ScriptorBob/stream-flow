<p>The Software is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects

    viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory
    rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a

    under applicable law.</p>
