Python Command:
```python
streamflow_fn_.module.RadialMenuWindow.call_pie_menu('Add_Objects_Pie_Menu')
```



This Menu is accessible through the Control Panel, in the `Geo` section.<br>
It can also be called by double tapping the "C" hotkey directly in Maya. This shortcut can be altered in the plugin settings.


It can create objects at the current position of the cursor, at every item in the selection, or at every selection island.
It will orient the new object according to the current transform space (world, object or component).<br>
The `per selection` and `per selection islands` options are on the bottom right part of the menu. These will be automatically hidden when the context doesn't allow for such options.
